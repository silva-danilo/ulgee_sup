This repository contains R scripts and dataset used in the simulation and application of the paper entitled Analysis of correlated unit-Lindley data based on estimating equations ([2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10260-023-00699-w)). To use them it is necessary to install the skeleton package available at https://github.com/silva-danilo/ulgee. Two examples with different types of correlation structures are also available.
